               Do Business Owners Care About Politics
 
 Motivation
  My main interest in this topic came from the recent 2020 election, how it seemed to take over everyones news and media and seemed to have a disproportionate impact on everyones lives. What I was interested in though was to what extent do Americans actually fear the results and the instability that shifts in power from elections cause, and what impact do elections have on the public mindset. To test these questions I decided to analyze data on new business that where announced. This focus on new businesses being created is supposed to represent Ameriocas mentality as a whole and how confident they are in starting new and risky endevours. As if the political climate is as disruptive and choatic to Amercian life as we are lead to believe then there should bea  reduction of new business beinjg born in fear of the election.
 
 Data Sources
  My source was the census.gov website that has information like how many businesses applications where inputed each week for the past 14 years. There are a couple of categories of new business applications but I mainly focused on the overall vallues and their changes. 
 
 Cleaning
  The first thing I cleaned up was I made was I made a data file with just the total business applications on ellection years, as well as the year leading up to the election to act as a baseline. I also used the data that compared changes from the same week of the previous year to analyze the changes of the shifts in percentages on election year vs the year prior. To analyze a more general view on the applications I also created a file with all non ellection year data and a seperate file with all election year data. I had to remove the recent 2020 election as the data was too much of an outlier and wouldnt represent the normal election year.
